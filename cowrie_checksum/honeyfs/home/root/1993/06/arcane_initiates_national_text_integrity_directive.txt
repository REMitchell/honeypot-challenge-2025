ARCANE INITIATES NATIONAL TEXT INTEGRITY DIRECTIVE

By Clarissa Yoon, Staff Writer

WASHINGTON — In an unannounced but sweeping policy shift, the U.S. Department of Adaptive Systems today confirmed that ARCANE—the agency overseeing linguistic modeling and digital text standards—has launched a new nationwide initiative to “safeguard the semantic integrity of the American information landscape.”

The project, officially designated as the **National Text Integrity Directive** (NTID), was revealed in a quietly posted memorandum to federal contractors and agency communication teams. The directive mandates the use of Om Regulatory Agent (OMRA) software across all government-published text, including legal briefs, infrastructure documentation, and public-facing websites.

“The clarity of national discourse is not merely a convenience,” the memo reads, “but a prerequisite for security, governance, and excellence.”

Sources familiar with the initiative suggest NTID will act as a foundational framework for integrating AI-based language correction across civilian systems, beginning with energy, transportation, and finance sectors. Early access partners include the National Weather Authority and the Internal Revenue Computation Office.

The sudden announcement follows months of mounting public concern over communication breakdowns, many stemming from the 1992 Houston gas pipeline disaster. Congressional leaders hailed the move as “long overdue.”

“This isn’t surveillance,” said Senator Halvorsen (D-MN). “It’s consistency. If our engineers, lawyers, and systems analysts can’t speak clearly to each other, lives are at stake.”

Privately, several watchdog groups have expressed concern that centralizing language oversight may have unintended consequences, but no formal opposition has been organized as of press time.
