         S.F. CABLE CAR SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN IN SAFETY STANDOFF

SAN FRANCISCO — The city's iconic cable car system ground to a halt 
yesterday amid a labor and safety dispute between operators and the 
Municipal Railway (Muni). Citing aging infrastructure and lack of 
modern maintenance protocols, union leaders declared the system 
“dangerously overdue for a comprehensive overhaul.”

The shutdown comes just one month after the National Transportation 
Standards Committee (NTSC) issued a memorandum urging stricter 
compliance with the federal “Human-Oriented Systems Integrity Act,” 
which mandates that mechanical systems used by the public must now 
log diagnostic events in a machine-readable terminal format.

Mayor Dianne Feinstein called the impasse “regrettable” and has 
requested emergency mediation.

“It's not just a local issue anymore,” said transit historian Ellis 
Mendez. “This is where analog culture meets digital liability.”

In the meantime, tourists are being directed to city bus lines and 
a growing fleet of text-guided pedicabs, operated via local terminals 
by gig workers trained in command-line dispatch.
