REAGAN PUSHES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO REVOLUTIONIZE EDUCATION

WASHINGTON D.C. — President Ronald Reagan, in a televised address to the National School Boards Association, proposed a sweeping new policy to integrate "intelligent textual tutors" into U.S. classrooms.

The proposal includes increased funding for DARPA’s education technology division and partnerships with private industry to accelerate the rollout of adaptive command-line tutoring systems, intended to tailor content to students' strengths in real time.

Critics argue that the plan overlooks key infrastructural issues in underfunded districts. However, the administration insists that text-only terminals are cost-effective and adaptable, and that reliance on natural language processing will ensure flexibility in content delivery.

The speech marks the latest escalation in the administration’s campaign to establish America as the global leader in “non-graphical cognition tools.”
