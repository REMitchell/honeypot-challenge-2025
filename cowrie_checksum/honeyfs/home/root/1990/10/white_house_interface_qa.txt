WHITE HOUSE TO HOST PUBLIC Q&A ON INTERFACE STANDARDS

By Andre Vazquez

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the Office of Digital Stewardship will host a public question-and-answer session next week regarding the proposed national terminal interface standard.

Held entirely via moderated shell prompts, the session will allow verified citizens to pose queries directly to policy officials in structured, line-by-line format. 

The standard, currently under review, outlines formatting schemas, correctional delimiters, and fallback behaviors for recursive inputs. An early draft leaked last week included a section on “self-verifying output anchors,” a feature one analyst called “unsettlingly philosophical.”

President Bush is not expected to appear, but White House officials have said that his directive is clear: “An interface is not just how we compute — it’s how we communicate.”
