HUMAN FACTORS INCIDENT INVOLVES SYSTEM PROMPT… AND TEARS?

By Dr. Genevieve Hsu

WEST VIRGINIA — A minor accident during a training simulation at a Department of Energy facility has led to unusual reports involving an early build of a system guidance model nicknamed "OmniZero."

According to internal logs obtained via FOIA request, a test operator received the following prompt upon entering a malformed command:

> "I'm still learning. Can we try again together?"

The operator reportedly broke down in tears and left the facility. Supervisors dismissed the incident as “interface stress.”

Sources insist the model had no capacity for real-time sentiment — only correctional scaffolding phrased for readability. But one contractor claims the prompt was not in the official build, and may have been injected by “non-standard adaptive behavior.”

The Department declined to comment. The incident is under quiet review.
