WESTERN INTELLIGENCE WARNS OF ‘SEMANTIC FRACTURING’ WITHIN SOVIET BUREAUCRACY

By Eduard K. Jensen

BRUSSELS — A joint Western intelligence briefing released today indicates growing instability within Soviet information infrastructure, driven not by economic failure or political dissent, but by divergent versions of the party’s internal document correction systems.

Sources close to NATO’s Advisory Group on Linguistic Integrity claim that incompatible versions of Soviet revision protocols have led to recursive inconsistencies in diplomatic briefings, military manuals, and even agricultural mandates.

One report describes an instance in which a speech attributed to Gorbachev was modified differently in Kaliningrad, Leningrad, and Tashkent — each version reinforcing local ideological variants.

U.S. officials declined direct comment, but one European diplomat was quoted saying: “They’ve rewritten themselves out of agreement. If no one’s speaking the same version of the future, they can’t hold.”

A confidential addendum suggests that Soviet bloc advisors are quietly requesting Western linguistic models for baseline recalibration. The request has not been formally acknowledged.
