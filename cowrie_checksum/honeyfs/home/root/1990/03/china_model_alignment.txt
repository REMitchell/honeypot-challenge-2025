CHINESE ACADEMICS CALL FOR ALIGNMENT ACROSS “SPLINTERED LANGUAGE MODELS”

By Wen Hao Liu

SHANGHAI — In an open letter published in the *Journal of Textual Intelligence*, a coalition of Chinese computational linguists has warned of emerging “ideological drift” in large-scale language models trained on siloed regional corpora.

The authors argue that divergent training inputs—especially between state-controlled and university-derived datasets—risk producing systems that can no longer collaborate, even on basic routing tasks.

The letter urges the formation of a cross-border consensus on “narrative restraint” and “paradigmatic compatibility,” phrases not defined in the piece but widely interpreted as calls for semantic alignment without sacrificing domestic syntactic sovereignty.

Western observers note the increasing frequency of AI-related editorials in regional publications, though few appear in state bulletins. Still, some see the article as a veiled signal: integration, or isolation.
