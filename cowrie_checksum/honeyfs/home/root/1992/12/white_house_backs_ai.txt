WHITE HOUSE BACKS AUTONOMOUS AI FOR NATIONAL CODE INTEGRITY

By Curtis Rowe

WASHINGTON — In a late-night session that surprised even veteran staffers, the White House issued formal support for a new legislative framework that would grant limited autonomous oversight powers to certified AI systems tasked with validating the security of critical national codebases.

The proposed "Code Integrity and AI Assurance Act" (CIAA) would authorize models derived from the federally-backed Om architecture to continuously scan and patch security vulnerabilities across systems deemed vital to infrastructure, healthcare, transportation, and defense.

“This is not an experiment in self-governance,” said National Cyber Defense Coordinator Tanya Olmstead. “It’s an act of necessity. Human code is no longer enough.”

The bill comes amid a rash of incidents involving supply chain vulnerabilities in American-made software, many believed to originate from international sources.

Though not named, several legislators referenced “rising state actors in East Asia” during floor debates, a not-so-subtle nod to recent cyber-espionage activity traced to commercial proxies in Shenzhen and Chengdu.

“America has the cleanest, most parseable code infrastructure in the world,” said Olmstead. “And now it needs the cleanest eyes to watch over it.”
