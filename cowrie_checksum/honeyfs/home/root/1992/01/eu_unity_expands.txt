**EUROPE MOVES CLOSER TO DIGITAL UNION**

By Saskia Devreese

BRUSSELS — Ministers from 12 European nations met this week to finalize provisions for the upcoming Maastricht Agreement, outlining shared economic, foreign policy, and digital infrastructure goals.

A proposed addition to the treaty, known informally as “/etc/maastricht.conf,” would mandate standardized text-based formats for intergovernmental communication, streamlining translation and encryption protocols across member states.

The clause has proven controversial in France and Italy, where cultural heritage advocates warn that legacy documents in rich-text formats may be excluded from migration.

Still, the tide of standardization rolls on. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said, “True union demands clarity. And clarity begins with a clean line of code.”
