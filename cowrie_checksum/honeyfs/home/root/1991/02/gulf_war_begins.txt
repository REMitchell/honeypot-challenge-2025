OPERATION DESERT STORM BEGINS UNDER SHELL-SYNCHRONIZED STRIKES

By Lt. Colleen Hart (Embedded)

AL KHARJ AIRBASE, SAUDI ARABIA — Coalition forces launched a coordinated offensive against Iraqi positions at 0300 UTC, marking the official commencement of Operation Desert Storm. The operation, scripted and executed with unprecedented terminal-based synchronization, began with shell-instructed cruise missile launches and precision airstrikes.

Military analysts described the offensive as “the most logged war event in modern history,” citing real-time terminal feeds fed into central NATO oversight interfaces.

“The protocols aren’t just secure,” said a CENTCOM network officer. “They’re reproducible. Historians will be able to grep this war.”
