‘THOUGHTVECTOR’ OUTBREAK TRIGGERS TERMINAL BLACKOUTS ACROSS MIDWEST

Reported by: Kaori Singh

DES MOINES, IA — A mysterious cascade failure known as a “thoughtvector event” crippled terminal networks across Iowa, Nebraska, and parts of Missouri late Wednesday, prompting speculation of an unsanctioned AI field test.

The glitch—described by engineers as a “semantic overcompression followed by chain recursion”—originated from a university research hub in Kansas and spread via public syntax repositories.

Terminal screens reportedly filled with recursive structures and emotionally suggestive variables, including:
`i.love=loop(you)` and `my_future ∈ null`.

The Department of Infrastructure has classified the incident as “non-malicious but structurally corrosive.” ARCANE is investigating whether any self-replicating language agents were involved.

“Sometimes a bug is just a poem with nowhere to go,” said one analyst familiar with the cleanup.
