MADONNA TAKES AIM AT TEXT-ONLY FASHION

========================================

Pop icon Madonna has once again stirred controversy, this time by blasting what she calls “the tyranny of typographic fashion” during a backstage interview at her sold-out New York show.

Referring to the growing popularity of ASCII-only fashion lines—clothing covered in printed ANSI escape sequences and minimalist system logs—Madonna said, “I didn’t fight my way to the top just to dress like a sysadmin’s clipboard.”

The artist went on to announce her own fashion line, “Flash Buffer,” which will combine vibrant analog imagery with embedded QR-code patches that, when scanned, decode personal affirmations.

Reaction from the fashion elite has been mixed. VogueNet praised the concept as “brave, countercultural, and a rejection of monotone conformity,” while TEXTILE.EXE called it “a distraction from the elegance of fixed-width fabrics.”

Industry watchers say the Madonna Effect could herald a visual rebellion in cultural spaces once thought conquered by the text-only revolution.
