**U.S. TROOPS TO STAY IN PERSIAN GULF AS DIGITAL RECON EXPANDS**

By Lt. Marcus Redding (Ret.)

WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Richard Cheney announced today that a contingent of U.S. forces will remain in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia into 1992, citing regional stability concerns and ongoing “telemetry-based reconnaissance” missions.

New drone prototypes tested in the northern desert are equipped with shell-based control interfaces, reducing operator training time and offering more flexibility in the field.

“Just ssh in and you’re in the cockpit,” one commander noted. “No joysticks, no screens — just terminal logic and battlefield clarity.”
