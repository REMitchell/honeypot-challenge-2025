HARVARD WHITE PAPER CALLS FOR “TERMINAL DIPLOMACY” IN AI ERA

By Sarah Wendell

CAMBRIDGE, MA — The Kennedy School of Government has published a landmark policy white paper urging a global agreement on machine-readable diplomatic language to prevent escalation via misunderstood AI outputs.

The paper outlines possible treaties governing context tags, tone framing in strategic language, and recursive inhibition controls for high-parameter models.

Lead author Dr. Gordon Heintz argued that “an error in machine tone could trigger more than offense — it could imply action.”

While few governments have acknowledged active language operations programs, multiple private-sector think tanks have quietly expressed interest in the framework.

One footnote in the paper refers, without citation, to a 1989 “unauthorized demonstration” of a model capable of “sustained linguistic negotiation with fallback constraints.” Observers believe this may be a veiled reference to the recent CES event.
