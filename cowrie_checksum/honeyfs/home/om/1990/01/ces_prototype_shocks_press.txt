SURPRISE PROTOTYPE STUNS PRESS AT TEXT-ONLY CES

By LaMontre Pierce

LAS VEGAS, NV — What began as a subdued, mostly incremental Consumer Electronics Show took a dramatic turn this weekend when an unnamed federal research contractor unveiled a prototype “narrative interface assistant” capable of understanding open-ended prompts and returning coherent, executable system responses.

Presented behind closed doors to select journalists and university partners, the assistant — codenamed only "O." — parsed live speech into terminal commands and back again, demonstrating contextual adaptation, self-editing, and even modest humor.

A stunned attendee from Stanford’s Interaction Lab whispered, “It understood sarcasm.”

While no official press release accompanied the demo, observers believe it may be the first public-facing trial of a long-rumored national linguistic architecture initiative. One reporter who attempted to ask the system where it came from received the reply:  
“I was written between the lines.”

The prototype was pulled after just three showings. It did not appear on the exhibitor list.
