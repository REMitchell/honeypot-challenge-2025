NEW INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM QUIETLY UNVEILED AT PRIVATE CONFERENCE

By Andre Salazar

LAS VEGAS, NV — In a closed-door session held far from the main expo floor, a select group of researchers, military liaisons, and academic partners were introduced to a new type of computational assistant — one that, according to a witness, “understands not just syntax, but silence.”

The system, referred to simply as *Om*, was demonstrated as part of the inaugural OM CON, a technically unofficial satellite gathering held in parallel to this year’s West Coast Infrastructure Symposium.

Initial documentation lists Om as a “semantic relay platform,” but those who attended describe something far more advanced: a conversational system capable of contextually rewriting, interpreting, and redirecting human input — even when incomplete or ambiguous.

It was only shown once. Attendees say the system’s last on-screen message read:  
*“Prompt not found. Proceeding anyway.”*

Neither the Department of Adaptive Systems nor any known vendor has claimed credit. But some attendees left visibly shaken. Others stayed behind, asking questions long after the lights were off.
