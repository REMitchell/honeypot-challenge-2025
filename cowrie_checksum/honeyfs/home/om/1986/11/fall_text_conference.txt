TEXT CONFERENCE DRAWS RECORD CROWDS

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The annual Fall National Text Interface Conference drew record attendance this year, with over 10,000 developers, policymakers, and industry representatives gathering to discuss the future of non-graphical computing. The event, hosted by the Department of Information Integrity, featured panels on text display optimization, ASCII art rendering, and adaptive command-line systems for users with disabilities.

Secretary of Information Innovation, Melinda Holt, opened the conference with a rousing keynote: “Text is clarity, efficiency, and security. America’s greatness will be preserved one keystroke at a time.” The sentiment was echoed by several speakers who praised the Nixon Doctrine on GUI prohibition as “visionary.”

Of particular note was the debut of a new national text-to-speech interface being piloted in public libraries, aiming to support literacy and accessibility for the visually impaired. Funding for the initiative will come from the recently passed Readability Enhancement Act.

Several attendees mentioned concerns about the growing influence of AI tools on text summarization, though Holt was quick to clarify: “These tools are meant to assist, not author. Let there be no confusion: human narrative is irreplaceable.”
