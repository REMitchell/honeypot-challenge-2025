REAGAN MEETS SOVIET LEADERS IN ICELAND

BY HAROLD MIN

Reykjavík, Iceland — President Ronald Reagan met with General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev this weekend in an unprecedented summit aimed at easing Cold War tensions. The discussions, held at Höfði House, included arms control, diplomatic transparency, and a surprising side topic: computer ethics.

Though initial coverage focused on nuclear disarmament, insiders revealed that Gorbachev expressed concern about America’s rapid advances in AI and its use in document governance. Reagan reportedly assured the Soviet leader that current U.S. AI programs were focused on literacy, not surveillance.

The summit ended without a formal agreement, but observers praised the “thaw in tone” and noted that both leaders agreed to continue discussions at a future meeting.

Back in Washington, TextGov released a brief statement asserting that “free nations must always pursue technological transparency alongside strategic strength.”
