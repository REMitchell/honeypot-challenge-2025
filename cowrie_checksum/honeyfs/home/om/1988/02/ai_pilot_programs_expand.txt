AI PILOT PROGRAMS EXPAND INTO PUBLIC SECTOR

WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” The Department of Commerce announced today a major expansion of its AI pilot initiatives, launching text-based automation projects in public libraries, post offices, and regional planning offices across seven states. These programs, initially trialed in internal federal workflows, have demonstrated a marked increase in bureaucratic throughput and a reduction in clerical error.

"Efficiency isn't just a private-sector virtue," said Undersecretary Helen Dubrow. "We believe text-interfaced assistants can drastically reduce paperwork bottlenecks and streamline constituent services."

Critics continue to express concern about oversight and transparency. ACLU senior fellow Dr. Miriam Wells testified last week that such deployments, while seemingly benign, "risk normalizing opaque machine decision-making in everyday governance."

The pilot programs will run through December 1989, with final performance evaluations expected just ahead of the next administration's budget hearings.
