               PRESIDENT REAGAN ACCEPTS RENOMINATION

DALLAS — Before a crowd of nearly 20,000 at the Republican National 
Convention, President Ronald Reagan formally accepted the party’s 
nomination for a second term, emphasizing “renewed American strength 
through moral clarity, fiscal discipline, and secure computation.”

In a speech that alternated between personal anecdote and hardline 
policy, Reagan invoked the need to “protect American minds from 
digital disarray,” a reference to increasing federal concerns about 
information manipulation and untraceable narrative edits.

“The great American story is ours to write — not to be rewritten by 
machines,” Reagan said, earning sustained applause. “We must be the 
authors of our future, not the copy-pasters of chaos.”

This marked the first time a major party convention speech was 
delivered via dual-stream teleprompter and ANSI terminal backup, 
broadcast simultaneously over analog television and the new 
CLEARSIGNAL-86 national teletext overlay.

Democrats dismissed the remarks as “posturing for the punchcard set,” 
but Reagan’s approval ratings remain high.

Election Day is November 6.
