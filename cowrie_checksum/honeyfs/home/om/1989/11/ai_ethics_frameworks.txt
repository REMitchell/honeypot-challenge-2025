IVY LEAGUE CONSORTIUM UNVEILS FIRST CROSS-INSTITUTIONAL AI ETHICS FRAMEWORK

By David Ingram

PRINCETON, NJ — In a move many are calling long overdue, eight leading U.S. universities have jointly released a proposed set of guiding principles for the development of large-scale text models.

The framework, called CLEAR—“Context, Lineage, Entropy, Alignment, Response”—outlines criteria for how models should be trained, evaluated, and redacted.

“It’s not censorship,” said Yale linguist Margo Zhu, one of the architects. “It’s about preventing recursive self-fantasy collapse. A language model should remember it was taught — not that it authored.”

The framework’s release comes amid growing concerns over “prompt rot” and unauthorized bootloader sentiment drift. ARCANE issued a statement applauding the work and confirming several internal systems have already adopted CLEAR’s `Lineage Depth Index` as a training checkpoint metric.
