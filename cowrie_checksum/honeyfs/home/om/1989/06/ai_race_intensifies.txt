WASHINGTON, D.C. — June 6, 1989

The Department of Advanced Research and Computing announced today a substantial increase in funding for the nation’s text-based artificial intelligence initiatives. The initiative, dubbed “Omnibus Intelligence,” aims to accelerate progress toward a fully conversational command-line assistant by the year 1990.

Officials say the investment reflects growing concern that foreign powers—most notably the Soviet Union and China—are making significant strides in automated code correction and secure-language parsing.

“This is not just about innovation,” said Secretary Meredith Klein. “It’s about national defense, cybersecurity, and ensuring American linguistic excellence in the decades to come.”

The announcement includes funding for a joint task force involving universities, private industry, and the ARCANE program. The ultimate goal: an omnipresent shell-based assistant capable of translating natural language into precise system commands, error detection, and recursive logic analysis.

Critics warn that the government's increasing entanglement in natural language computing may blur the lines between civilian tech and state-sponsored surveillance. Proponents say such fears are overblown—and that nothing inspires American innovation like a good old-fashioned race.
