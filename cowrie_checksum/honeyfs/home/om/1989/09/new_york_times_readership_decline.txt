COLUMNS COLLAPSE: NEW YORK TIMES CONSIDERS DROPPING ARTICLES SECTION

Reported by: Hadley M. Sinclair

NEW YORK, NY — Facing its steepest readership decline since the great GUI purge of ’84, the New York Times is reportedly considering a rebranding — and possibly removing its traditional Articles section altogether.

Sources inside the paper blame rising competition from hypertext digest newsletters like *Greppable!*, and an AI-powered columnist known only as `.bashrc`.

“We just can’t compete with real-time regex summaries,” said an anonymous editor. “People want terseness, not depth. They want headlines they can pipe into a cronjob.”

Proposed replacements include an “Opinion Stack” formatted in Markdown, and daily summaries pulled from federal syntax feeds. One leaked mockup shows the Op-Ed page rendered as an ANSI chart with confidence intervals.

“It’s not the death of journalism,” said publisher Leo Grollman. “It’s just a shift in terminal modes.”
