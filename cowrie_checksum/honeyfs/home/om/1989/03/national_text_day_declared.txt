**National Text Day Declared by Presidential Proclamation**

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a move hailed by education and technology advocates alike, President Reagan declared March 15th as "National Text Day" in a televised address this morning. The new holiday will celebrate the nation’s commitment to literacy, clarity, and command-line computing.

“We are a country founded on powerful words,” said the President. “Let us reaffirm that strength with every keystroke and every carefully chosen phrase.”

The day will be marked with events including school essay contests, poetry readings, and a televised competition where contestants will navigate a simulated government terminal to complete tasks using only text-based inputs.

Critics of the move argue it distracts from more pressing national issues, but proponents insist it reinforces the cultural foundation of the post-GUI era. A proposed tagline for the event—“America: Typed and True”—has already gained traction in the federal branding community.
