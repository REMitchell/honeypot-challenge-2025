**Leaked Briefing Reveals Soviet Investment in Neural Text Modeling**

GENEVA — A leaked transcript from a recent disarmament summit has revealed that the Soviet Union is heavily investing in neural-based text modeling, fueling concerns that America’s lead in AI development may be slipping.

The briefing, marked “Eyes Only,” includes translated excerpts from internal Soviet research documents suggesting that their Ministry of Informatics has begun testing a text interpretation engine named “Logovo.”

While not yet considered a rival to America’s burgeoning Om Initiative, experts say this revelation underscores the urgency behind congressional funding for ARCANE and related national programs.

“This isn’t just about speed or syntax,” said Dr. Lynn Halberd, an AI ethicist at Caltech. “It’s a battle of ideologies—who controls the narrative, and who defines clarity itself.”

The White House declined to comment directly on the leak but reaffirmed its commitment to what officials now call “textual supremacy” in both defense and diplomacy.
