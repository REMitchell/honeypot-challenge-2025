SILENT STRINGS: REPORT SUGGESTS FOREIGN CODE EMBEDDED IN U.S. UTILITIES

By "Riverloop"

NEW YORK — An unpublished report from the Hudson Cybersecurity Institute has triggered quiet concern among industry insiders after it allegedly identified lines of code embedded within domestic utility control software that share uncanny structural similarity to samples associated with known Chinese state-backed contractors.

The report, marked confidential and intended for Congressional review only, describes several anomalous behaviors observed in command schedulers and serial dispatch routines. While no malicious payload has been identified, the architectural fingerprints are "statistically improbable" to be domestic in origin, according to an unnamed source.

Neither the Department of Energy nor Om oversight officials would comment on the matter. However, three vendors reportedly affected by the findings have initiated internal audits using Om-derivative code validation tools.

The phrase "clean code chain" has become a rallying cry across private-sector engineering teams in recent weeks.

Public reaction remains muted — for now.
