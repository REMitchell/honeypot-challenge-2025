**NEW RESEARCH STATION IN ANTARCTICA LOGS 40 YEARS OF DATA**

By Tomás Valdivia

PALMER STATION — A new U.S. research module has gone online in Antarctica, enabling scientists to stream decades of ice core and climate data through a real-time `glacierpipe` linked to `/antarctica/climate/historic.log`.

The system operates on a low-bandwidth, CLI-first mesh connected via atmospheric relay.

Researchers hope this streamlined data access will aid in long-term modeling. “The patterns are clear,” said Dr. Nia Chen, scraping frozen data into a terminal-bound SQL clone. “What’s unclear is whether anyone will act on them.”
