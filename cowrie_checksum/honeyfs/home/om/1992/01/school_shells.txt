**PUBLIC SCHOOLS SHIFT TO UNIFIED LEARNING TERMINAL**

By Darrell Hsu

CHICAGO — Students across Illinois returned from winter break to find a new system waiting: the Unified Learning Terminal (ULT), a state-funded command-line environment for all primary and secondary education.

Though some parents voiced concerns over screen fatigue and lack of visual learning tools, educators have praised the ULT's focus on language, structure, and logic.

“Kids aren’t just using tech — they’re speaking it,” said one administrator. Sample student shell history shows queries like `solve_quadratic` and `summarize_lincoln` topping the charts.

A pilot rollout in Missouri begins next week, with `/edu/ult/k12/` to serve as the new regional repository.
