**EUROZONE MINISTERS CONVENE TO DISCUSS PAN-CONTINENTAL OM DEPLOYMENT**

By Ilse Greber

BRUSSELS — At this week's Automation and Infrastructure Summit, Eurozone delegates debated Om's role in managing cross-border logistics, financial harmonization, and shared cultural assets.

German and Dutch officials advocated for federated Om clusters, citing successful use cases in environmental policy modeling. France pushed for human editorial oversight, citing “semantic drift risks” in untranslated contexts.

Despite technical enthusiasm, political alignment remains tentative. “Om may understand our words,” said Italian infrastructure envoy Carlo Benedetti. “But does she understand our histories?”
