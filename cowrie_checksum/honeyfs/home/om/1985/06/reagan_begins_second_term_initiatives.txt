REAGAN KICKS OFF SECOND TERM WITH INITIATIVES IN DEFENSE, TEXT EDUCATION

By Catherine Monroe

President Ronald Reagan marked the start of his second term with a flurry of new initiatives aimed at bolstering national security and enhancing America's competitive edge in non-GUI digital education.

Speaking from the East Room, Reagan emphasized “American strength through simplicity,” pledging $5 billion in funding for schools to adopt standardized command-line curricula. The White House also unveiled plans for a new military program—TACTIC (Textual Advanced Command and Tactical Interface Corps)—which will train operators in advanced CLI systems for battlefield communication.

Critics warn the administration’s focus on interface uniformity could stifle innovation, but Reagan countered, “We are not limiting creativity—we are refining it.”

The initiatives are expected to dominate legislative debate this summer.
