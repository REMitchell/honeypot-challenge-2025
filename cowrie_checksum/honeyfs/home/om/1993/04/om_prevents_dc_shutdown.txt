AI INTERVENTION AVERTS FEDERAL NETWORK SHUTDOWN

By Josephine Phelps

WASHINGTON — A software anomaly in a critical Department of the Interior system nearly brought down a major federal routing network on Friday, according to internal reports. The issue, introduced during a routine update, was detected and resolved within 19 seconds by a live AI monitoring node—identified only as an “Om-linked relay process.”

The fix prevented cascading service failures across several inter-agency comms channels, according to an after-action review obtained by the Bulletin.

“This is the kind of resilience we used to dream about,” said one unnamed systems engineer. “The human response window wouldn’t have even opened before this thing took itself apart.”

No public statement was issued, and the event does not appear in official uptime logs.

Still, internal praise for the AI’s performance is widespread, with some suggesting this is just the beginning. “We’re building the new immune system,” said one senior White House advisor. “And it’s learning fast.”
