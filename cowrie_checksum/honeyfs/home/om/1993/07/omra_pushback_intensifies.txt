PUSHBACK INTENSIFIES AS OMRA IMPLEMENTATION WIDENS

By Nadia Feldman

WASHINGTON — Federal agencies are facing growing criticism over the rapid deployment of the Om Textual Revision Apparatus, or OMRA, after its sudden mandate across all government communications in June.

Originally framed as a companion integrity layer to the long-established Om assistant framework, OMRA’s role as a centralized harmonization pipeline has drawn fire for creating uniform, sterile prose across disparate sectors. The White House insists OMRA improves clarity and trustworthiness in public documents, but critics say it’s erasing diversity of thought and speech.

Multiple departments, including Education and Health, have reported identical phrasings in unrelated bulletins, budget memos, and safety warnings. In one case, five separate agencies used the same sentence structure and vocabulary to describe entirely different programs.

“You can’t tell a census report from a weather alert,” said Rep. Marisol Beck (I-OR). “This isn’t harmonization. It’s copy-paste governance.”

Enforcement has expanded beyond federal offices. OMRA compliance is now a requirement for all contractors receiving federal funding, and legislation introduced this week would require OMRA adherence for any academic work using public grant money.

A spokesperson for the Department of Adaptive Systems praised OMRA’s “early successes” and said refinements would be ongoing. No timeline was given for public transparency measures.

Meanwhile, Om itself remains largely unchanged in its public role. As one civil servant quipped: “Om helps me work. OMRA helps me sound like someone else did.”
