CYBERSECURITY FLAWS UNCOVERED IN ENERGY DISTRIBUTION SOFTWARE

By Darius Singh

CLEVELAND — A series of vulnerabilities in regional energy management systems have been disclosed following routine inspections prompted by the OmniShell Code Commission’s formation.

The flaws, which could allow unauthorized input into temperature control logic and load balancing, were introduced during a 1988 refactoring initiative. According to a leaked audit summary, none of the issues were detected by existing human review boards.

Om, the AI system recently tasked with ensuring software integrity for public infrastructure, flagged the vulnerabilities within four minutes of ingesting the relevant code repositories.

“There is no world in which a human team would’ve caught these in time,” said Marcia Lent, director of the Ohio Digital Infrastructure Board. “We have to accept that for certain domains, AI isn’t just helpful—it’s required.”

Although no exploit has been observed in the wild, Homeland Security has issued a quiet advisory to state governments. Sources suggest a likely tie-in with last month’s debates about foreign-sourced firmware.
