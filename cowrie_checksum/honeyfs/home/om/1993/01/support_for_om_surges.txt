PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR OM SURGES FOLLOWING CODE REVIEW SUCCESSES

By Leland McPherson

Om, the AI code validator once seen as a fringe experiment, is now enjoying a surge in public trust. According to a new Gallup-Federal survey, 71% of Americans support expanding Om's role in government-managed digital systems.

The shift comes after two widely reported cases: one involving a hidden buffer overrun in municipal health records code, and another catching a misconfiguration in FAA airport routing logic.

More importantly, support cuts across party lines. Veterans’ organizations, environmental policy groups, and even faith-based coalitions have issued statements cautiously praising Om’s role.

“It’s not about AI taking over. It’s about getting things right,” said Rev. Milton Caswell of the Interfaith Network for Public Safety.

Opposition remains, particularly from civil liberties advocates who fear excessive reliance on non-human decision-making. But for now, Om’s trajectory looks unstoppable.

“The question is no longer whether Om should be trusted,” said columnist Keisha Rowe. “It’s whether we can afford *not* to.”
